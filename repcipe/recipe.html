    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Bread – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</h3>
    <h3>Butter – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. </h3>
    <h3>Cheese – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</h3>

    <h2>How to Make Grilled Cheese?</h2>
    <h3>1. Butter the toast – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</h3>
    <h3>2. Heat skillet – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down. </h3>
    <h3>3. Add cheese – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</h3>
    <h3>4. Brown the toast – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</h3>
    <h3>5. Serve – cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</h3>

    <h2>Tip</h2>
    <h3>Eating with tomato soup and haotsause will make it taste better!</h3>
